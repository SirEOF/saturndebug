Saturn Debugger (c) Tyranid 2000
===============

This is the source code for my old Sega Saturn debugger I wrote a long time ago. It probably
won't compile properly anymore but it shows how bad my coding can get :)

Released into the public domain, use as you see fit. Obviously the usual caveats, no warranty 
etc. Don't blame me if your house burns down.
